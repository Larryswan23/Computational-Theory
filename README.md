# Countdown Numbers Game Solver

This repository contains a Python implementation of a solver for the Countdown Numbers Game, a popular segment from the British television show "Countdown". This solver utilizes a combination of recursive backtracking, arithmetic operations, and permutation strategies to find a path to the target number using a set of given numbers.


## Features

- **Recursive Backtracking Algorithm**: Employs a depth-first search approach to explore all possible combinations of operations between the selected numbers.
- **Arithmetic Operations Supported**: The solver handles addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division, ensuring all division results in whole numbers.
- **Permutation of Numbers**: Tests all permutations of the provided numbers to maximize the chances of finding a solution.
- **History Tracking**: Outputs the step-by-step operations used to reach the target number, useful for understanding the solution process.
